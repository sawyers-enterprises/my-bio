    bio: "As a new father and a home-owner my career is critical to our lifestyle. I'm looking to cleanly demonstrate my skills, experience and aptitude towards the profession. I've covered everything from service-desk support (ITIL) functions, right through to server deployment/configuration. Got several years experience in networking including obtaining my CCNA. I studied the Just-IT programme too.",
