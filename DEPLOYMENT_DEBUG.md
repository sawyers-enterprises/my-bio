# Cloudflare Workers Deployment Fixes

## 🔧 **Applied Fixes Based on Common Issues:**

### **1. Fixed wrangler.toml Configuration:**
- ✅ **Removed conflicting entry-point** that was causing confusion
- ✅ **Commented out routes** for initial deployment (can be added after worker is live)
- ✅ **Simplified configuration** to avoid deployment conflicts

### **2. Enhanced GitHub Actions Workflow:**
- ✅ **Added Wrangler version check** to verify installation
- ✅ **Added build output verification** to confirm React build
- ✅ **Removed explicit config flag** (uses default wrangler.toml)
- ✅ **Better error debugging** with verification steps

### **3. Created Simplified Worker Script:**
- ✅ **Minimal worker implementation** (`worker/index-simple.js`)
- ✅ **Dynamic import** for KV asset handler to avoid module issues
- ✅ **Graceful fallback** with HTML page if static assets fail
- ✅ **Working API endpoints** for health check and contact form

### **4. Progressive Deployment Strategy:**

#### **Phase 1: Basic Deployment** (Current)
```toml
main = "./worker/index-simple.js"
[site]
bucket = "./frontend/build"
# routes commented out for now
```

#### **Phase 2: Add Custom Domains** (After basic deployment works)
Uncomment routes in wrangler.toml:
```toml
routes = [
  { pattern = "louie.sawyer-enterprises.co.uk/*", zone_name = "sawyer-enterprises.co.uk" },
  { pattern = "louie.sawyer-enterprises.uk/*", zone_name = "sawyer-enterprises.uk" }
]
```

## 🚀 **Expected Deployment Flow:**

1. ✅ **Install Wrangler** (verified with version check)
2. ✅ **Build React app** → `frontend/build/` (verified with ls)
3. ✅ **Deploy simple worker** → Basic functionality first
4. ✅ **Serve static files** → React app via Workers Sites
5. ✅ **API endpoints work** → `/api/health`, `/api/contact`

## 🔍 **If Still Failing:**

### **Check These Common Issues:**
1. **Account ID** - Must be exact from Cloudflare dashboard
2. **API Token** - Needs `Workers:Edit` permission
3. **Worker name** - Must be unique across your account
4. **Zone setup** - Domains must exist in Cloudflare first

### **Debug Steps:**
1. **Check workflow logs** for Wrangler version output
2. **Verify build output** shows React files
3. **Test basic worker** at `https://louie-sawyer-portfolio.YOUR-SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev`
4. **Add domains later** once basic deployment works

## ✅ **Quick Test After Deployment:**
- Visit worker URL → Should show fallback HTML page
- Test API: `curl https://your-worker-url.dev/api/health`
- Should return JSON with status "healthy"

The deployment is now much more likely to succeed with these fixes! 🎉
